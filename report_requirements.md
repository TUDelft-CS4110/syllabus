### Requirements for the report

In the report, you should write down what you did for the lab, what techniques you used, what problems you encountered when using them, what results you obtained. Essentially, you have to demonstrate that you understand the the used techniques and tools (by explaining what it is they aim to do), and are capable of applying them in practice (by showing what you did), in order to obtain insightful results (by reporting on them).

We understand that not all tools are equally easy to use. This means that even if you do not manage to obtain insightful results, by reporting on the encountered problems, and possible solutions you implemented to circumvent these, you can obtain a good grade. But in this case it is especially important to report on these issues and on the tried solutions. Sometimes, fixing such issues can be more important for the advancement of these techniques than succesfully applying them to new problem instances.

An overview of the different sections of the report would be: introduction, describe techniques (may reuse summary if possible), decribe tools (may reuse summary), decribe problem isntance (what code you apply them to), report on encountered problems and implmented solutions, report results, reflect on these results in the conclusions.
